<h1>>Blog App</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<span>Built using: TypeScript, Firebase and Tailwind</span>

Design: Taken from Dribbble - https://dribbble.com/shots/15238065-Blog-Personal-Website/attachments/6986428?mode=media

Approaches: 8-point grid and Mobile-first

My own notes before writing the SRS
User registration and login: Users should be able to register and log in to the application using Firebase Authentication.
Blog post creation and editing: Users should be able to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts. Posts should include a title, body text, and image. Posts should be stored in Firebase Firestore.
Blog post display: The application should display a list of all blog posts, with the most recent post at the top. Each post should include the title, a preview of the body text, and the author's name.
Blog post detail view: Users should be able to click on a post to view it in full, including the title, body text, image, and author's name.
Responsive design: The application should be designed to be responsive and accessible on all screen sizes and devices, using an 8-point grid and a mobile-first approach. Tailwind CSS should be used to implement the responsive design.
Search and filtering: Users should be able to search for blog posts by title or author, and filter the list of posts by author or category.
Categories and tagging: Users should be able to assign categories and tags to their blog posts, and view all posts within a specific category or with a specific tag.
User profiles: Users should have their own profile pages, displaying their name, bio, and a list of their blog posts.
Deployment: The application should be deployed to a hosting service, such as Firebase Hosting or Vercel
